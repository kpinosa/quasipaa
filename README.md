As you can see, I am probably a person who focuses on audio and video development, but I also know something about traditional front-end and back-end. To sum up, I know a little bit of everything, but I can't say I am proficient in it.

- `Rust`, The main language used in recent years.
- `JavaScript/TypeScript`, The technology stack mainly used in the early years.
- `Go`, Golang is very simple, I have mastered it so far, but I donâ€™t have a deep understanding.
- `C++`, My current degree: c with class + a little std + smart pointer.
- `C`, The current problem is that the toolchain is hard for me to use.
- `Kotlin`, Hey! I only use kotlin to write SDKs for android apps!
- `C#`, Use it only to develop plugins for unity projects.
- `Scala`, I've almost forgotten all about it.
